# Test Project README

## Description

This test project is designed to demonstrate a simple testing scenario. It focuses on testing a web-based contact form to ensure that it properly validates the "Message" field as mandatory. The project uses Selenium WebDriver in Python for automated testing.

## Testing Strategy

For this challenge, we employed the following testing strategy:

- **Test Objective:** To verify that the contact form correctly validates the "Message" field as mandatory and displays an appropriate error message when left empty.

- **Test Environment Setup:** We set up a test environment with Selenium WebDriver and the Chrome WebDriver for automated testing.

- **Test Steps:**
    1. Navigate to the contact form page.
    2. Fill in the user's details, including Name, Organization Name, Phone Number, Email, and Job.
    3. Leave the "Message" field empty.
    4. Submit the form.
    5. Verify that an error message is displayed indicating that the "Message" field is required.

- **Test Automation:** We used Python and Selenium to automate the test steps..

## Running the Test Project

## Running the Test Project

To run the test project on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. **Prerequisites:**
   - Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your machine.
   - A Java Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like Eclipse or IntelliJ.
   - Selenium WebDriver for Java (include the Selenium WebDriver JAR files in your project).
   - Added the TestNG for the test execution
   - Just need to click on run as testng and the whole test will be triggred.

2. **Clone the Repository:**

   git clone [(https://github.com/iamniket/SATechTest.git)https://github.com/iamniket/SATechTest.git]

3. **Import the Project:**
- Open your Java IDE and import the project.

4. **Execute the Test:**
- Run the `TestOne` class, which contains the test scenario.

5. **Configuration:**
- Ensure that the Chrome WebDriver is correctly configured in your project. You may need to download the ChromeDriver executable and specify its path in your test code.

This will run the automated test scenario on the contact form.
